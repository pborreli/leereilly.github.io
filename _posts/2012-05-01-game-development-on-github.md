I’m always blown away by [GDC](http://www.gdconf.com/) attendees’ passion for games - especially the students, recent graduates and indie developers there to network and break into the industry. I’ve heard more than a few people say that the most valuable thing about the GDC is the connections that they make; it's these connections that help them find their dream jobs in professional game development.

I'd like to take a few moments of your time and tell you about another way to connect, get noticed and perhaps find your dream job.

## Geting Noticed

In 2010 [Jacob Minkoff](http://jacobminkoff.com/) delivered an inspiring talk about [getting noticed](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxW0lq47mcE&feature=player_embedded), advising people how they could get their foot in the door. *If you want a job in the games industry, stop what you're doing right now and watch his talk.*

Jacob suggests that you need to make game content if you want to get a job in the industry and recommends that you

* buy a game with an editor and start making levels
* make a tech demo or utility draw concept art, make models, textures, etc.
* compose music or re-foley an existing game

He goes on to say that you should share all of this on a web site. Sure, you could spend hours setting up a free/hosted Wordpress site, customize some free/premium themes and spend days making it look awesome, but what are you trying to accomplish?

You probably want to show off your beautifully written, thoroughly tested game code. You probably want people to to easily find and download your content. You probably want your game to go viral and make you Internet-famous for a day. You probably want a safe place to store your projects. You probably want a career in the games industry, want to collaborate and learn. Right? If the answer is "yes" to one or more of the above, please read on...


## Share, Sell and Better Yourself with GitHub

Use GitHub and you will

 * become a better developer
 * learn about version control
 * learn about code review
 * learn how to collaborate on projects
 * learn about change control
 * learn how to submit bug fixes
 * learn how easy it is to share your code and collaborate with other developers

A GitHub account will document all of your work and can serve as your portfolio / resume. Your contributions, collaborations and personal projects that you hosted on GitHub will help you get noticed.

## Potential employers will see your work.

Game development companies like [Blizzard](https://github.com/blizzard), [Zynga](https://github.com/zynga), and [Unity](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies) use GitHub. A number of other companies use [GitHub Enterprise](https://enterprise.github.com) internally. **A GitHub profile will show a recruiter that you're passionate about game development.**

## Getting Started

There are plenty of [excellent resources on getting started with Git and GitHub](http://help.github.com/). Once you've learned the basics, where do you go from there? In addition to sharing some of your own projects on GitHub, you could look at some open source games, libraries, frameworks, etc. and contribute by

* fixing a bug
* refactoring some code (e.g. for better readability/performance)
* adding some test coverage
* adding some documentation
* adding a map/level/thing
* cloning it and deriving your own work from it

You might even have someone add to your code or want to use bits of your game in their projects.
